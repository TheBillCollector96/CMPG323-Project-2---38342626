###-NWU Tech Trends API-###

The NWU Tech Trends Management System identifies how much time is saved every time an automation that Tech Trends created has run.
This API is uniquely developed to work together with NWU Tech Trend's system in order to make use of the data stored in the server's database.
The API was developed in ASP.NET Core NET 8 and deployed on Azure network cloud servers.
